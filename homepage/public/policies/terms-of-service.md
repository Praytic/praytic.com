## The Praytic Terms of Service

Effective date: January 1, 2025

## A. Definitions

**Short version:** _I use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what I mean when I use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information._

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with Praytic Services. A "Personal Account" represents an individual User's authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User's identity on Praytic Services.
1. The "Agreement" refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the "Terms of Service" or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the Praytic Privacy Statement, available at [praytic.com/privacy](https://praytic.com/privacy)) and procedures that I may publish from time to time on the Website.
1. "Content" refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. "User-Generated Content" is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by my Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
1. "Praytic," "I," and "Me" refer to Praytic LLC, as well as its affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
1. "Praytic Services" refers to the websites, applications, and services under the praytic.com domain operated by Praytic LLC.
1. The "Service" refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by Praytic Services.
1. "The User," "You," and "Your" refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age.
1. The "Website" refers to websites located at [praytic.com](https://praytic.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by Praytic Services at or through the Website. It also refers to subdomains of praytic.com. Occasionally, websites under praytic.com may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## B. Account Terms

**Short version:** _A human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure._

### 1. Account Controls

Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.

### 2. Required Information

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case I need more information about the legal entity).

### 3. Account Requirements

I have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on Praytic Services.
* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account.
* You must be age 13 or older. While I am thrilled to see brilliant young people get excited by using my services, I must comply with United States law. Praytic Services do not target the Service to children under 13, and I do not permit any Users under 13 on my Service. If I learn of any User under the age of 13, I will [terminate that User's Account immediately](#g-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country's minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country's laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person â€” i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people.
* You may not use Praytic Services in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction.

### 4. Account Security

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use my Service. I offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.
* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account.
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. Praytic Services cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify me by contacting me at praytic.global@gmail.com if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, my Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

## C. Acceptable Use

**Short version:** _While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other._

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances:
* Harass, abuse, threaten, or incite violence towards any individual or group
* Use my servers for any form of excessive automated bulk activity, or to relay any form of unsolicited advertising or solicitation
* Attempt to disrupt or tamper with my servers in ways that could harm my Website or Service
* Access the Service for competitive purposes
* Violate the privacy of any third party, such as by posting another person's personal information without consent
* Use the Service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose
* Violate any applicable law or regulation through your use of the Service

## D. User-Generated Content

**Short version:** _You own content you create, but you allow me certain rights to it, so that I can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant me are limited to those I need to provide the service. I have the right to remove content or close Accounts if I need to._

### 1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. I am not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### 2. I May Remove Content

I have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in my sole discretion, violates any laws or my terms or policies.

### 3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, I need you to grant me â€” and other Users â€” certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 â€” D.5. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting me the permissions I need to run my Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 â€” D.5. The licenses you grant to me will end when you remove Your Content from my servers.

### 4. License Grant to Me

I need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant me and my legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to my database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on my servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant me the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant me the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of my provision of the Service.

### 5. Moral Rights

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against me, to enable me to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant me the rights I need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## E. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy

If you believe that content on my website violates your copyright, please contact me at praytic.global@gmail.com. If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content violates your rights, please provide me with the following information:

* A physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on their behalf
* Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed
* Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing
* Your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and email address
* A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material is not authorized by the copyright owner
* A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner

I will terminate the Accounts of repeat infringers of this policy.

## F. Intellectual Property Notice

**Short version:** _I own the service and all of my content. In order for you to use my content, I give you certain rights to it, but you may only use my content in the way I have allowed._

### 1. My Rights to Content

### 1. Account Cancellation

It is your responsibility to properly cancel your Account. You can cancel your Account at any time by contacting me at praytic.global@gmail.com.

### 2. Upon Cancellation

I will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with my legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce my agreements, but barring legal requirements, I will delete your full profile and the Content within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

Upon request, I will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation or termination. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation or termination.

### 3. I May Terminate

I have the right to suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. I reserve the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.
