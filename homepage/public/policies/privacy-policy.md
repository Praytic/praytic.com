## Praytic Privacy Statement

Effective date: January 1, 2025

Welcome to the Praytic Privacy Statement. This is where I describe how I handle your "Personal Data", which is information that is directly linked or can be linked to you. It applies to the Personal Data that Praytic LLC processes as the "Data Controller" when you interact with websites, applications, and services under the praytic.com domain (collectively, "Praytic Services" or "Services").

### Third Party Access and Data Protection

When you use third-party extensions, integrations, or follow references and links within our Services, the privacy policies of these third parties apply to any Personal Data you provide or consent to share with them. Their privacy statements will govern how this data is processed.

## Personal Data I Collect

I collect minimal Personal Data necessary to provide and secure my Services. Below, I detail the information I collect:

### From You

* Account Data: I collect your name and email address when you create an account.
* User Content: When you use my Services, I collect content you provide such as text, data, images, location data, and map markers.
* Support Data: When you seek customer support, I collect only information you provide.

### Automatically

* Essential Cookies: I use cookies to provide essential functionality like keeping you logged in and remembering your preferences.
* Geolocation Information: I collect regional geolocation data based on your IP address to provide location-based features.
* Service Usage Information: I collect basic technical data such as IP address, device information, and session details necessary to operate and secure my Services.

### From Third Parties

* Authentication Services: When you sign in using third-party authentication (such as Google or Facebook), I receive your name and email address based on your settings with those services.

## Processing Purposes: How I Use Your Personal Data

I practice data minimization and use only the minimum amount of Personal Information required to operate my Services.

## Sharing of Personal Data

I do not sell, rent, or share your Personal Data with third parties for marketing or advertising purposes. I only share Personal Data in the following limited circumstances:

* Service Providers: I may use service providers (such as hosting providers) to operate my Services. These providers are contractually obligated to protect your data and use it only to provide services to me.
* Legal Requirements: I may disclose Personal Data when required by law or in response to valid legal requests from authorities.

## Lawful Bases for Processing Personal Data (Applicable to EEA and UK End Users)

Praytic Services process Personal Data in compliance with the GDPR, ensuring a lawful basis for each processing activity. The basis varies depending on the data type and the context, including how you access the services. My processing activities typically fall under these lawful bases:

* Contractual Necessity: Processing is required to fulfill my contractual duties to you, in accordance with the [Praytic Terms of Service](/policies/terms-of-service).
* Legal Obligation: I process data when it's necessary to comply with applicable laws or to protect the rights, safety, and property of Praytic Services, users, or third parties.

This is done only when these interests are not overridden by your data protection rights or your fundamental rights and freedoms.

## My use of cookies and tracking technologies

### Cookies and tracking technologies

Praytic Services use cookies only for essential operational purposes. I use them to (i) keep you logged in, (ii) remember your preferences, and (iii) maintain the security and integrity of the Services.

I do not use cookies for advertising, marketing, or tracking your activities across other websites.

The length of time a cookie will stay on your browser or device depends on whether it is a "persistent" or "session" cookie. Session cookies will only stay on your device until you stop browsing. Persistent cookies stay until they expire or are deleted.

#### What are cookies?

Cookies are small text files stored by your browser on your device. A cookie can later be read when your browser connects to a web server in the same domain that placed the cookie. This allows the web server to recognize your browser and maintain your session.

#### How do I use cookies?

I use cookies only for essential purposes:

* **Required Cookies**: I use required cookies to perform essential website functions and provide my Services. For example, cookies are used to keep you logged in and save your preferences. These cookies are necessary for my Services to work.

## US State Specific Information

This section provides extra information specifically for residents of certain US states that have distinct data privacy laws and regulations. These laws may grant specific rights to residents of these states when the laws come into effect. This section uses the term “personal information” as an equivalent to the term “Personal Data.”

### Privacy Rights

These rights are common to the US State privacy laws:

* Right to Knowledge and Correction: You have the right to request details on the specific personal information I've collected about you and the right to correct inaccurate information. You can exercise this right by contacting me. You can also access and edit basic account information in your settings.
* Right to Know Data Recipients: I share your information with service providers for legitimate business operations, such as data storage and hosting. For more details, please see "Sharing Your Information" below.
* Right to request Deletion: You reserve the right to request the deletion of your data, barring a few exceptions. Such exceptions include circumstances where I am required to retain data to comply with legal obligations, detect fraudulent activity, investigate reports of abuse or other violations of my Terms of Service, or rectify security issues. Upon receiving your verified request, I will promptly delete your personal information (unless an exception applies), and instruct my service providers to do the same. I employ brief retention terms by design.
* Right to a Timely Response: You are allowed to make two free requests in any 12-month period. I commit to responding to your request within 45 days. In complex cases, I may extend my response time by an additional 45 days.
* Non-Discrimination: I will not hold it against you when you exercise any of your rights. On the contrary, I encourage you to review your privacy settings closely and contact me with any questions.

### Notice of Collection of Personal Information

I collect minimal categories of personal information necessary to operate my Services: identifiers/contact information (name, email), user-generated content (text, images, location data), and basic technical information (IP address, device information).

I collect this information solely to provide and secure my Services, troubleshoot technical issues, and comply with legal obligations.

### Exercising your Privacy Rights

To make an access, deletion, or correction request, please send an email to praytic.global@gmail.com and follow the instructions provided. I may need to verify your identity before processing your request. If you choose to use an authorized agent to submit a request on your behalf, please ensure they have your signed permission or power of attorney as required.

Please be aware that I do not disclose personal information to any third parties for their direct marketing purposes as defined by this law. California Customers may request further information about my compliance with this law by emailing praytic.global@gmail.com. Please note that businesses are required to respond to one request per California Customer each year and may not be required to respond to requests made by means other than through the designated email address.

#### Removal of Content

California residents under the age of 18 who are registered users of online sites, services, or applications have a right under California Business and Professions Code Section 22581 to remove, or request and obtain removal of, content or information they have publicly posted. To remove content or information you have publicly posted, please contact me at praytic.global@gmail.com with a detailed description of the specific content or information you wish to have removed.
